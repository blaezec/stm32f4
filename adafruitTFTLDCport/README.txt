you need the STM32F4 library and source in ../../
you need the arm-none-eabi-gcc compiler

to compile type:
make

to load using the stm32 boot loader, you need dfu-util (you will use the micro-b usb connector on the board).
Once you have dfu-util working, cd to your working directory, connect BOOT0 pin to 3V pin and press reset.

Now type:

sudo dfu-util  --device 0483:df11 --alt 0 --dfuse-address 0x08000000 --download TFTLCD_test_FSMC.bin

Disconnect the BOOT0 pin from the 3v pin. Press reset. your software is now running on st32f4 discovery (or crashing...).

I used FSMC D[8:15] pins on the stm32f4, with the adafruit '2.8" 18-bit color TFT LCD with touchscreen breakout board
- ILI9325' (http://www.adafruit.com/products/335). $40. Usually out of stock. She wired it to use 8 bit data bus, so it
would work with avr ÂµControllers (read: arduino). It's hardwired that way, it could be 2X as fast with the stm32f4,
than it is w/ 8 bit data bus. 

You can use D[0:7] if you want, it seems to work. But LED5 and LED6 are on pins FSMC D0 and D1 and the signal is a bit droopy because
of that. To use D[0:7], go into TFTLCD.c, line 870 or so, (/********************************** low level readwrite interface */)
and comment out the d[8:15] versions of
writeData
writeCommand
readData

and uncomment the d[0:7] versions.

If you have an LCDTFT with one of the ILI controllers and with all 16 data pins broken out, you can look at 

writeData
writeCommand
readData

and change it to just write or read once in each function (comment out stuff that looks like this: *fsmcRegister=cmd<<8; ).
